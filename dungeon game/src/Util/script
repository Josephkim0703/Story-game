So how did you find out about the ruins most people only believe as a fairytail

Um i just heard someone talking about it at a bar

wait so you know nothing about the ruins of alexnadria and why theres people searching for it

um not really

oh my god well let me tell you why you see every 5000 years a huge island emerge from the sea
bringing choas with it narutral disaster which caused famines and wipes the planet clean its like
the world is cleansing itself

the worse thing that came out of the island was the death plaque

what the death plaque was from the island??! 

yes a virus from the island made it to mainland spreading like wild fire causes millions to die but this was no ordinary virus it 
mutated the victims turning them into savage barbaric monsters no race was safe even the powerful high elves could not do anything

but the people that saved us were non other then humans you see human dont have the organ that can store or process mana so human can not use
magic but due to the virus some human instead of mutating into monster instead evolved and gain supernatural abilities surpassing magic

you see magic is created through storing mana inside one self and using is as a sort of fuel

oh so kind of like gun powder

exactly but these humans instead of storeing the mana and outputting magic instead was like as if there body produced the magic itself
its as if these powers were apart of them.

these human are known as the 12 pillars there powers passed though generations though not all the bloodlines survived and only 4
of the 12 still are still known to be alive

wait so king Aine is one of those 12 pillar kids

yes he is a descendant of one of them.

but just cause the virus was handle did not mean the disaster was over 

before the world could be wiped out 1 powerful high elf mages as well as 2 of the pillars sacrifaced themselves and sealed the island and stopped it from
submerging into the ocean so the cycle doesnt repeat itself

The only way onto the island is to find the teleportaion circle left by the mage only one remain
and it is said its hidden deep in a dungeon filled with traps making sure no one can reach it

people rumor that the reason the island bring such chaos is becuase its protecting somthing pricless on the island others say the mages isnt dead 
but sealed it away and faked his death to keep the island to himself.

and to think you were going to search for alexandira with no clue in the world is well really funny

Thats why I have you now partner so where to well from my research the plaque first started in the southern region in a small village
its located near a huge canyon that could be where the circle is.

Wait are you talking about Lyrindell thats where I'm from and now that you speak of it I remeber there being a huge cave system i used
to explore as a kid that could be the dungeon.
